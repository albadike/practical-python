# Exercise 1.27
# Now that you know how to read a file, letâ€™s write a program to perform a simple calculation.

# The columns in portfolio.csv correspond to the stock name, number of shares, and 
# purchase price of a single stock holding. Write a program called pcost.py that 
# opens this file, reads all lines, and calculates how much it cost to purchase 
# all of the shares in the portfolio.
